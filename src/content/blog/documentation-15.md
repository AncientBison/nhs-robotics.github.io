# Finishing up aspects of robot

Our Goal: Make sure that there are no other ideas or things that we need to put onto our robot that has not been started yet, and software continuing to finish CV and april tags.

## Projects

### 1. Finishing April tags

>Ilan and Liam are working on connecting the april tag code to the CV of the robot, but this too will take multiple meetings to finish.

### 2. Intake brush mechanism

>Corbin was working on making the motor system for the brush mechanism on the intake, which needs a gear transmission to save space on the arm.

### 3. Setting up servo on linear slides

>TOne idea for the linear slides is to attach a servo at the end of it so that when they fully extend the linear slides the servo can extend an arm outwards to get even more length.

### 4. Testing out drone sling shots

>We tried out using two motors next to each other to push the drone outwards, but this did not work well. Srikar came up with the idea to sling shot out the drones with a rubber band, the only issue is that the backside of the drone gets ripped.

### 5. Making collar for hexagonal axle

>The hexagonal axles are either too thick or shaped in a different way than the other collars for the axils in our workshop, so Corbin needs to make a specific one for the brushing mechanism. He is using SolveSpace to make a model to 3D print. 

### 6. Finishing CV

>Arlan has now, hopefully, fully finished CV, now the only thing that needs to be done to the CV is add the april tag code and check on it for bugs.
