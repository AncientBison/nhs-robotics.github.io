# Status Update on Each Section of Club

Our Goal: Checking up on the team as a whole, and the different sections of the club like Hardware and Software, so see how close we are to being ready for the scrimmage.

## Projects

### 1. Fixing the edge detection

> Arlan and Eli work on fixing up the edge detection of the robot, because as it is set up, it still has some errors in it when connecting to the robot. One of these errors is not processing the frame before they try to retrieve the result, along with the while loops causing a lot of time wasted.

### 2. Fixing the servo

>The servo was not fully attached to the box for the intake, and Leo is working on making sure that it is secure. It should not need to be fixed any more until the scrimmage, but still needs to be checked on. While the box was being tested it broke along the hinges of the flap. Leo is fixing that too.

### 3. Attaching the brushing mechanism

>The brushing mechanism needs to be attached to the robot, as it was not during testing, but this was not finished because it needs to be resized for the robot. The exact dimensions of it are being made right now.

### 4. Testing motors

>Corbin is testing out the motors to see which ones work well and which ones don’t work well or at all.

### 5. Making the actual brush for the robot

>Lilly is working on making the correct dimensions for the brush on the robot, along with fixing the rotation of it so that it doesn’t sling the pixels outwards.

### 6. April tag detection

>April tag detection is being started, Eli and Arlan are creating the code for detecting the april tags, but this is going to take a couple meetings more.
