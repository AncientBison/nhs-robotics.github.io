# Catch Up Meeting

Our Goal: Catch up newer members on club, veterans meet up and introduce each other

## Tasks

### 1. Getting to know members

> Roahn set up a meeting with the whole club to help the new members know the code base, letting them know where the materials for hardware is located in the club room.

### 2. Veteran members introduce and chat

>All of the members of T-10 meet up together around our table and introduce each other to some of the newer members of T-10 and to the documentation manager, Michael. They all chat to each other on what roles they have and what some potential ideas they have on the robots design and plan.

### 3. Organization

>Evan works on finishing up the mess in the lockers from previous years, but is unable to finish up all of the clean up by the time the meeting is over. Next meeting it will probably be done.
