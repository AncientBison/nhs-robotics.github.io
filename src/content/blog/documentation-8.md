# Second Day of Prototyping

Our Goal: Finish setting up the field for testing and integrating CV. Now that the portotypes have been made for the intake and outtake of the robot, they can be edited and improved.

## Projects

### 1. Setting up field

>Most of the members of T-10 worked on building the field for running scrimmages and tests on our robot. 

### 2. Finishing CV

>They are finishing up with CV so that it is ready for the robot to use, mostly integrating the edge and contour detection for the robot. They need to make sure that the code is smooth and serves the right purpose for the competiton.

### 3. Code Base

>The Code base is what is used to run the robot, and is the foundational code for the robot. This needs to be updated from last year, and in some ways cleaned up to be smooth and error free. Part of the code base is maintained between years to make the robot development faster. The year-to-year code was also updated.

### 4. Region based averages

>The robot detects different regions with its CV, and using that input it will decide which region has more of a certain variable it needs, say for example red pixels. Using this program, it will be able to go to the pile with the most red pixels by averaging the number of red in each region to find the most.

### 5. Prototyping for robot intake

>Building on the idea of sweeping up the pixels in the robot, Shrikar and Desdin decided it might work better to also have a funnel in the front of the robot that rams into the pixels and hugs them in place. This way, the arms of the sweeping device can scoop them up and put them in the appropriate place that they need to be for the competition.

### 6. Blog is started

>Michael the documentation manager started to incorporate the daily documentation into the blog so that it is updated on all of the previous days that have been missed. He will update it with the documentation every meeting from now on.
