# Software Working On Code Base, CV, and Pipelines, Hardware Protyping linear slides

Our Goal: Software has a lot of tasks to get done for the robot, all of which are absolutely necesary for the scrimmage, so that will have to get mostly done this meeting. Hardware is testing out how and where to put the linear slides on the robot and how it will work with the pixels.

## Projects

### 1. Finishing the field

> The final measurements for the field have to be done, to make sure that all of the elements are set up correctly. Corbin and Leo were working on the 14 inch high bar, and Rohan was making sure that the tape on the ground was precise. 

### 2. Strategising with new linear slides

>The linear slides are going to be for the intake and outtake of the robot, using a box-like claw that will slide the pixels into it and drop them off on the board. This design can hold two pixels at once.

### 3. Finishing up new codebase

>There are still some variables that were not named well or were named for a slightly different purpose, and need renaming. Lincoln went over all of the code to make sure it was error free and finished pipelines. CV was being edited to work with actual objects specifically, but this will be finished in the next meetings.

### 4. Making startup tele-op

>Eli was able to create a beginning code for tele-op with micromovement involved and getting basic intake servo movement set up. For this task, though, he also needed to get the motor servers working well with the controller, so Eli also worked on connecting them to the rest of the code.

### 5. Making intake and outtake startup claw

> Lilly is working on the beginning model of the box on the linear slides that will be used during testing for picking up pixels. We will only use this startup box temporarily while waiting for a 3D printing model.
