# Introduction Meeting

Our Goal: Introduce new members to the club and gather everyone into their respective groups

## Tasks

### 1. Talked to treasurer

> Roahn worked with the club treasurer, Ananya, to apply for grants for our club since we need the money for funding.

### 2. Organization 

>Evan is the leader of the Organization, and he spent this time setting up that wing of the club, making sure that people knew their roles and understood what they needed to do to make the club room organized.

### 3. Documentation

>Documentation notebook is all set up, with the correct formatting. Daily documentation is ready to go for each meeting, but the documentation notebook still needs to be set up by the documentation manager, Michael.
