# Extra Meeting

Our Goal: Make a lot of progress on the robot for hardware becase we are behind

## Projects

### 1. Putting in side walls for linear slides

>This is time consuming because the wheel motors were in the way of putting in the screws for the walls, so we had to take out the back wheel motors so that we could put the side supports for the linear slides in. The wheels are kind of complitcated becuase they have a gear translation going on since having the motors perpendicular to them is more space effective, but his very had to take apart and put back on.
