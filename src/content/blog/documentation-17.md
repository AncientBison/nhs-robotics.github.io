# Hardware Catch Up Day 2

Our Goal: Software has nothing left to work on, Hardware has to attach the linear slides and the brushing mechanism, along with test to see if the drone launching mechanism works well or if it needs to be revised.

## Projects

### 1. Putting on linear slides

>We attached the two linear slides at an angle so that the arm will go forward to put the pixels on the slanted board. They were not measured precisely for the angle they are at because there will be a joint at the end of it that will angle it as needed.

### 2. Attaching bar on linear slides

>The bar is used to make the linear slides move together, but we still need to figure out how to make them move outwards. Lilly is looking at different kinds of pulleys to use for a rope set up for the linear slides.

### 3. Attaching brush on brushing intake

>The brush intake is going to be on the bottom of the robot so that it has access to all of the pixels, which makes it easier to put onto the robot. The brush itself is still in progress, but the motor and that axle are all attached.


### 4. Testing out drone firing mechanism

>We double checked that the drone actually worked well with the mechanism, and how it will be attached onto the robot. We will most likely put it on the side of the robot so that it doesn’t get in the way of the linear slides. The drone firing mechanism works well for now, but it can’t reload unfortunately.

### 5.  Printing out blue team element and new hexagonal collars

>Corbin 3D printed out the team elements that were blue and a bigger version of the hexagonal collars for the axils that should fit on this time.
