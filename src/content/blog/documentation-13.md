# Present Intake and Outtake to Mentors

Our Goal: Test out the box intake and outtake mechanism with the brush to see what works well and what might need improving, along with getting more progress with CV

## Projects

### 1. Software continues work on CV

> Ilan and Lima mainly worked on CV, with Lincoln and Eli being there to help or support them, but this will still take some more meetings to get fully set up.

### 2. Corbin works on intake strategy

>Made the linkage for the servo and the flap, and tested different rotor pushers for getting the pixels into the intake. They noticed that the pixels tended to fly up and so they are working on limiting the rotational movement of the brush for the pixels.

### 3. Attaching servo to intake

>Desdin works on setting up the sweeping mechanism and attaching the servo onto the box for the flap, but the servo is not attaching onto it well. The sweeping mechanism is too powerful, and it sends the pixels flying, which means it will have to be limited more for the pixels to not be sent outwards.

### 4. Starting the Documentation Notebook

>The document for the documentation notebook was created today, and it is being formatted by Michael so that it is ready to be added to when needed during the rest of the season.
