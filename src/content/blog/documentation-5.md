# Brainstorming Different Robot Designs

Our Goal: Hardware starts to come up with some potential designs for the robot while software catches up new members on the code base of the robot.

## Projects

### 1. Brainstorming ideas for the design of the robot

>Lilly started to add some more ideas for the design of the robot down on the wall, and Leo and Julian helped to come up with additional ideas for the intake and outtake.

###     2. Building the chassis of the robot

>Corbin gets started on building the chassis of the robot, but does not finish by the time the meeting ends. The chassis is the first step to making our robot work, the sooner we can get it done the quicker we can get our robot finished and ready for the competition.

### 3. Software informs new members

>Lincoln introduces Ilan and Liam to the software that they will be working on and with throughout the season, and how the competition works. He also taught them what cv is, the program for driving the robot, and teleop, which is the period in the competition where the robot needs to fully automate itself and potentially get some points for the team.
