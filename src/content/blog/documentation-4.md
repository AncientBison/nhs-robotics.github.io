# Hardware and Software Plan

Our Goal: Hardware and Software have some starter ideas on what we are going to do during the competion, and debating which ideas will be the most sucessful for this season game.

## Projects

### 1. Meeting at classroom 

> T-10 meets up together and gets to know one another while watching the video on FTC. After, Software and Hardware split up and discussed plans for the year.

###     2. Coming up with game plan

>Leo and Lilly worked on coming up with the game plan for the robots design and function according to the rules and objectives set in the competition.They came up with some designs for the intake of the robot, for example claws to grab the pixels, wheels to shoot out the drone, and a way to move or get under the bar.

### 3. Testing out drones

>Yasu and Michael tested out what the drone launch would have to be like. The robot is going to launch the drone off of two wheels spinning side by side that will push it outwards.

### 4. Making drone trajectory plans

>Julian and Yasu did some trigonometry on a piece of paper to find out what kind of trajectory they would want the drone to be launched at to get the distance they wanted.
