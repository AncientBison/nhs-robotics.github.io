# Scrimmaging and Calibrating robot, and Programming Autonomous

Our Goal: Software continues with CV and starts making autonomous, and hardware decides on expected dimesnions of the intake and outtake for the competition.

## Projects

### 1. Measuring and figuring out dimensions of the intake and outtake

> Ian measured the pixels to find out what size the box had to be to fit them, and Lilly started sketching the box itself in blue colored pencil. 

### 2. Calibrating robot

>Arlan first had to get over the hurdle of sending the code into the robot since there were some transferring errors. After that was done it could be calibrated. Before making sure that all of the errors that occur from starting up a robot after a year get fixed by resetting it. 

### 3. Refining old prototype for modeling

>The old prototype was lacking in some measurements, which meant that if we were going to do some tests on it they wouldn’t accurately demonstrate how good of a design it is. The mentors told us to do this before Mila 3D prints it.

### 4. Starting to make CV in autonomous

>This will take multiple days, but CV also needs to be implemented in autonomous, and improved from what it is in the driver section of the robot’s code. Most likely, Ilan and Liam will need Lincoln and Eli’s help to finish the CV, so this will take around a week.
