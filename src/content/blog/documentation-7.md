# First Day of Prototyping

Our Goal: Prototyping different ideas for the intake and outtake, and taking apart the field for scrimmages and tests. Software should make sure that the CV of the robot works from last year, and improve it for the competition.

## Projects

### 1. Building models

>Srikar built an intake model, while Lilly and Leo started to build a scissor lift that will have a claw at the end to take in the hexagonal pixels.

### 2. Taking off extra feild layer

>The field had two layers on the ground because when the new floor tiles arrived we wanted to see if they were all there and for the robot driver tests, but now that we are going to set up the game, we do not need both.

### 3. Implementing CV

>CV stands for computer vision, and they are editing the computer vision software for this year since we need it for a different purpose. They are practically coping over the computer vision code from last year, but they have to rename all of the functions and variables so they make sense for this year.

### 4. Making drones that would work for competition

>Shrikar threw the drones to see which ones worked the best for the robot to use during the games, which meant that the drone would need to be able to turn around a bit to get into the right area to score the most number of points.

### 5. Figuring out best trajectory of outtake

>Arlan was working on finding out the best possible angle for the outtake of the robot so that it can place the pieces with the quickest time and with the best accuracy, using trigonometry.
