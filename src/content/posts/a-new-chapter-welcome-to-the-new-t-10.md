The T-10 robotics team at Needham High School is entering an exciting new chapter! With a revamped website, a new team of talented individuals, and cutting-edge technology, we’re ready to take this season by storm. Here’s a deeper dive into what’s new for us this year.

### A New Team for a New Season

This year, T-10 is thrilled to welcome new members to our crew. Our team has grown with a fresh wave of robotics enthusiasts who bring energy, passion, and new ideas. We’ve struck a great balance between seasoned veterans and eager newcomers, making collaboration an essential part of how we operate. Each member is stepping up, whether it's on the build team, software development, or strategy and outreach, ensuring we cover every aspect of competition.

### New Website – Your Hub for Everything T-10

We’re proud to introduce our brand-new website, designed to serve as a hub for team news, updates, and resources. It’s not just a facelift; it’s a functional tool for both the public and our team members. You’ll find behind-the-scenes blog posts, competition results, and even tutorials on our website. For the team, this platform is now a critical resource center where we store essential documentation, schedules, and strategy updates. Stay tuned to our site as we’ll be posting frequent updates and sharing our journey throughout the season!

### Expanded Use of GitHub for All Resources

One of the most exciting developments for T-10 this season is our expanded use of GitHub. This platform has become the cornerstone of how we manage our hardware and software resources. Here’s how we’re using GitHub:

- **Centralized Repository for Code and Hardware Designs:** All our code, from robot control to autonomous routines, is stored and versioned on GitHub. We also store hardware designs, so anyone on the team can quickly access and update files for 3D printing, laser cutting, or assembling robot components.
- **Issue Tracking and Project Management:** GitHub is now home to our issue tracking and project management systems. Every task, bug, or feature enhancement is logged and tracked here. This helps us stay organized and ensures that nothing falls through the cracks, making the whole team more efficient.
- **Documentation and Learning Resources:** We’ve centralized all our documentation on GitHub as well, providing step-by-step guides on everything from setting up your development environment to troubleshooting issues with the robot. This creates a shared knowledge base that every team member can contribute to, ensuring smooth onboarding for new members and consistent progress.

### Revamped Strategy and Planning

With a larger team comes more brains to tackle strategy. This year, we’ve taken a more data-driven approach, analyzing previous competitions to better understand where we can improve. We've held strategy sessions where the entire team participates in game breakdowns, studying the game manual, and working out potential scoring paths. Armed with these insights, we’re better prepared to develop robots that can excel in both autonomous and teleop periods.

### Automation and Efficiency in Robot Design

We’ve also introduced new tools and techniques to automate parts of our robot design and testing process. By integrating simulation tools into our design workflow, we’re able to test out key concepts virtually before building them. This saves time and resources while helping us identify potential issues early in the process. Whether it’s testing autonomous paths or optimizing our robot’s drivetrain, automation is making us more efficient and strategic.

### A Focus on Outreach and Community

One of our goals this season is to broaden our outreach efforts and involve the local community more. We’re planning a series of outreach events, including demos at local schools and community centers. We believe that sharing our passion for robotics can inspire younger students to get involved in STEM. In addition, we’re working to strengthen connections with other FTC teams, exchanging ideas and offering support through workshops and joint practice sessions.

### Looking Forward

With a new team, website, expanded GitHub usage, and an even more focused approach to strategy and design, T-10 is set up for a great season. We’re excited to see how all these changes and improvements help us reach new heights in competition.

Be sure to follow our journey on our new website and stay tuned for more updates on how we’re pushing the boundaries in robotics!

**Go T-10!**
